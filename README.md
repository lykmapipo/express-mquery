express-mquery
====================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lykmapipo/express-mquery.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lykmapipo/express-mquery)

Expose [mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose) query API through HTTP request with partial support of [json-api](http://jsonapi.org/): 
 - [sparse-fieldsets](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sparse-fieldsets)
 - [sorting](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sorting)
 - [pagination](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-pagination)
 - [filtering](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-filtering)
 - [includes](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-includes)

*Note: Due to refactoring, you must install [mongoose-rest-actions](https://github.com/lykmapipo/mongoose-rest-actions) to have back mongoose plugin*

## Installation
```js
$ npm install --save express-mquery mongoose-rest-actions
```

## Usage
```js
//plugin rest actions plugin
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const actions = require('mongoose-rest-actions');
mongoose.plugin(actions);

//add express middleware
const expess = require('express');
const mquery = require('express-mquery');

const app = express();
app.use(mquery({ limit: 10, maxLimit: 50 }));

...

app.get('/users', function(request, response, next) {
  
  //obtain request.mquery
  const options = request.mquery;

  User
    .get(options, function(error, results) {
      ...handle error or reply
    });

});
```
## Structure
Once parse, `express-mquery` will extend `http request` with `mquery` field

Example:

```js
GET /invoices?fields=number,amount&filter[name]=Bob
&filter[amount][$gte]=1200&include=customer,items
&fields[customer]=name,number&fields[items]=name,price
&page[number]=1&page[size]=10&sort[number]=1&sort[amount]=-1
```

Will be parsed into:
```js
{
  filter: { name: "Bob", amount: { $gte: 1200 } },
  paginate: { limit: 10, skip: 0, page: 1 },
  populate: [
  	{ path: "customer", select: { name: 1, number: 1 } },
  	{ path: "items", select: { name: 1, price: 1 } }
  ],
  select: { number: 1, amount: 1 },
  sort: { number: 1, amount: -1 }
}
```

Where:
- `filter` : Is valid `mongoose` criteria and can be passed to `find()`
- `paginate` : Contains paging details that can be passed to `limit()`, `skip()`
- `populate` : Is valid `mongoose` populate option and can be passed to `populate()`
- `select` : Is valid `mongoose` project options and can be passed to `select()`
- `sort` : Is valid `mongoose` sort options and can be passed to `sort()`


## Querying

>When passing values as objects or arrays in URLs, they must be valid JSON

### Sort
```js
GET /customers?sort=name
GET /customers?sort=-name
GET /customers?sort={"name":1}
GET /customers?sort={"name":1, "email":-1}

or

GET /customers?sort=name
GET /customers?sort=-name
GET /customers?sort[name]=1&sort[email]=-1
```

### Page
```js
GET /customers?page=1
GET /customers?page=1&limit=10
GET /customers?page[number]=1&page[size]=10
```

### Skip
```js
GET /customers?skip=10
```

### Limit
Only overrides `maximum limit option set by the plugin` if the queried limit is lower
```js
GET /customers?limit=10
```

### Query or Filters
Supports all [mongodb operators](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/) `($regex, $gt, $gte, $lt, $lte, $ne, etc.)`

```js
GET /customers?query={"name":"Bob"}
GET /customers?query={"name":{"$regex":"/Bo$/"}}
GET /customers?query={"age":{"$gt":12}}
GET /customers?query={"age":{"$gte":12}}

or

GET /customers?filter[name]=Bob
GET /customers?filter[name][$regex]="/Bo$/"
GET /customers?filter[age][$gt]=12
GET /customers?filter[age][$gte]=12
```

### Populate or Include
Works with create, read and update operations

```js
GET /invoices?populate=customer
GET /invoices?populate={"path":"customer"}
GET /invoices?populate=[{"path":"customer"},{"path":"products"}]

or

GET /invoices?include=customer
GET /invoices?include[customer]=name,number&includes[items]=name,price
GET /invoices?include=customer,items&fields[customer]=name,number&fields[items]=name,price
```

### Select or Fields
`_id` is always returned unless explicitely excluded

```js
GET /customers?select=name
GET /customers?select=-name
GET /customers?select={"name":1}
GET /customers?select={"name":0}

or

GET /customers?fields=name
GET /customers?fields=-name
GET /customers?fields=name,email
GET /invoices?include=customer&fields[customer]=name
```
